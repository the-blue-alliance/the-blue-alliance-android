<p><i>Note: The Blue Alliance's district ranking are not official and are calculated using the FRC Standard District Points Ranking System.</i></p>
<p><strong>FRC Standard District Points Ranking System Overview:</strong></p>
<p>Teams will earn District Points at the <i>first two</i> District Events they attend, as well as at their District Championship. In order to calculate the total number of District points earned by a Team in a season, multiply the number of points earned at District Championship by three then add them to the number of points earned at District Events.</p>
<p>Teams will earn two points for each qualification match they win, one point for each tie, and zero points for each loss. In the elimination tournament, an alliance captain will earn the number of points equal to 17 points minus their alliance captain number (the #2 alliance captain would earn 17-2 = 15 points) and a team picked for an alliance will earn 17 points minus the number of their draft pick. During the elimination tournament, teams earn five points for each match won that they participated in, but only if they win 2 out of 3 matches in the series.</p>
<p>Team will also earn points for awards. A Chairman's Award is worth 10 points, Rookie All Start and Engineering Inspiration are worth 8 points each, and all other judged Team awards are worth 5 points.</p>
<p>Rookie teams will also receive a 10 point bonus, while second year receive a 5 point bonus.</p>
