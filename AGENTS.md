# Agent Guidelines

## After Every Checkpoint

After completing each checkpoint, create a detailed commit message summarizing all changes made. The commit message should include:

- A short summary line describing the checkpoint
- A list of all new files created
- A list of all files modified
- Key architectural decisions made
- Any dependencies added

This ensures clear traceability of what changed at each step of the rewrite.
